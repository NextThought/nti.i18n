1.1.0 (unreleased)
==================

- Initial PyPI release. This implements a subset of the ``plone.i18n``
  APIs (not including flag resources) but with updated data and
  reduced dependencies.

- Python 3 and PyPy compatibility.

- Data live in external files so that they are hopefully easier to update.
